#### Things I'm planning to do


##### Linear

Why Spark has lower AUC? 

Multinode time & AUC




#### Things I'm not plannning to do, so if someone wants to do it, let me know 



##### Linear

Python with sparse format

Another dataset, e.g. 100M/1B? rows and more columns too (10x 10M has been done
but AUC not valid)



##### Random Forests

Python sparse? (I don't think it has)

Spark AUC why so low?

Spark speed/RAM optimization
