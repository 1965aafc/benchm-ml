#### Things I'm planning to do


##### Linear

Spark Multinode time & AUC




#### Things I'm not plannning to do, so if someone wants to do it, let me know 


##### All

Another dataset, e.g. 100M/1B? rows and more columns too (10x 10M has been done
but AUC not valid)



##### Linear

Python with sparse format



##### Random Forests

Python sparse? (I don't think it has)

Spark speed/RAM optimization

test other implementations [fest](http://lowrank.net/nikos/fest/), 
[RT-Rank](https://sites.google.com/site/rtranking/home)


##### Boosting

More extensive hyper-param search would be nice
